# Route Optimization Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing routes for efficient transportation and delivery planning. By leveraging data analytics, graph algorithms, and machine learning techniques, it aims to minimize travel time, reduce costs, and improve overall route efficiency.  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and route visualization  
- Implementation of shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, A*)  
- Optimization techniques for multi-stop routing  
- Integration of real-world traffic data (if applicable)  
- Performance evaluation and analysis  

## Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NetworkX, Scikit-learn, etc.)  
- SQL for data storage and querying  
- Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Folium, etc.)  

## Usage  
1. Load the dataset containing location and distance data.  
2. Run the optimization algorithms to find the best route.  
3. Visualize and analyze the optimized paths.  

## Future Improvements  
- Real-time route updates  
- Dynamic traffic prediction  
- Integration with mapping APIs (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
